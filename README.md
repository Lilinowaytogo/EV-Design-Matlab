# EV_structural_design_Matlab
 The MATLAB/Simulink development environment is available for this purpose.
The design of the vehicle carried out in this project focuses on modelling the longitudinal dynamics of an electric vehicle, and some of the simulation parameters can be altered to suit the design requirements or application conditions. 
More comprehensive documentation requirements can be obtained by email due to the private nature of the request.
CN:该项目主要是对电动汽车的纵向动力学建模，任务中包含不同的应用情景. 建议首先查阅Structure.png文件.
